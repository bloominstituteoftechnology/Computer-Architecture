#Number Bases:
'''
12 apples
or
0xC apples
or
0b1100 apples


types of numbers:
Decimal  base 10, 
Binary - base 2, 
Hex -    base 16, 
Octal -  base 8
or base 64

base represents the number of digits
power of 2 relationship in all bases


a = 123 <-- this is base 10
a = 1101 <-- base 10 as well

a = 0b1101 <-- binary

a = 0xFF <-- hex


When stored, base is specified during the execution!

COUNT:
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

first digit in 10 represents the number of 10s we have
10


so:
1234
thats:
one 1000
two 100
three 10
four 1

1 * 1000 + 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 4 * 1 = 1234

'''
# +--------128s place
# |+-------64s place
# ||+------32s place

# ||||+----8s place (0b1000's place)
# |||||+---4s place (0b100's place)
# ||||||+--2s place (0b10's place)
# |||||||+-1s place (0b1's place)
'''
COUNT IN BINARY:
0 
1
then add another place:
10
11
then other place holder
100
101

110
111

1000
'''
# what is the  1101 in binary:
'''
place values in the destination place and add them up
so : 8 + 4 + 0 + 1
'''
# binary to HEX:
'''
4 binary digits == 1 hex digit
Byte is 8 bits

11010011
split into 4s:
1101  0011
leading zeros dont matter!!!
so:
0011 is 3 
and
1101 is d 

so inhexodecimal:
0b11010011 == 0xd3



0xff

f    f
1111 1111
0b11111111 == 255 == 0xff
