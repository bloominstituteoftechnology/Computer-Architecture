# LS-8 Microcomputer Spec v4.0

## Registers

8 general-purpose 8-bit numeric registers R0-R7.

* R5 is reserved as the interrupt mask (IM)
* R6 is reserved as the interrupt status (IS)
* R7 is reserved as the stack pointer (SP)

> These registers only hold values between 0-255. After performing math on
> registers in the emulator, bitwise-AND the result with 0xFF (255) to keep the
> register values in that range.


## Internal Registers

* `PC`: Program Counter, address of the currently executing instruction
* `IR`: Instruction Register, contains a copy of the currently executing instruction
* `MAR`: Memory Address Register, holds the memory address we're reading or writing
* `MDR`: Memory Data Register, holds the value to write or the value just read
* `FL`: Flags, see below


## Flags

The flags register `FL` holds the current flags status. These flags
can change based on the operands given to the `CMP` opcode.

The register is made up of 8 bits. If a particular bit is set, that flag is "true".

`FL` bits: `00000LGE`

* `L` Less-than: during a `CMP`, set to 1 if registerA is less than registerB,
  zero otherwise.
* `G` Greater-than: during a `CMP`, set to 1 if registerA is greater than
  registerB, zero otherwise.
* `E` Equal: during a `CMP`, set to 1 if registerA is equal to registerB, zero
  otherwise.


## Memory

The LS-8 has 8-bit addressing, so can address 256 bytes of RAM total.

```

## Stack

The SP points at the value at the top of the stack (most recently pushed), or at
address `F4` if the stack is empty.


## Interrupts

There are 8 interrupts, I0-I7.

When an interrupt occurs from an external source or from an `INT`
instruction, the appropriate bit in the IS register will be set.

Prior to instruction fetch, the following steps occur:

1. The IM register is bitwise AND-ed with the IS register and the
   results stored as `maskedInterrupts`.
2. Each bit of `maskedInterrupts` is checked, starting from 0 and going
   up to the 7th bit, one for each interrupt.
3. If a bit is found to be set, follow the next sequence of steps. Stop
   further checking of `maskedInterrupts`.

If a bit is set:

1. Disable further interrupts.
2. Clear the bit in the IS register.
3. The `PC` register is pushed on the stack.
4. The `FL` register is pushed on the stack.
5. Registers R0-R6 are pushed on the stack in that order.
6. The address (_vector_ in interrupt terminology) of the appropriate
   handler is looked up from the interrupt vector table.
7. Set the PC is set to the handler address.

While an interrupt is being serviced (between the handler being called
and the `IRET`), further interrupts are disabled.

See `IRET`, below, for returning from an interrupt.

### Interrupt numbers

* 0: Timer interrupt. This interrupt triggers once per second.
* 1: Keyboard interrupt. This interrupt triggers when a key is pressed.
  The value of the key pressed is stored in address `0xF4`.

## Power on State

When the LS-8 is booted, the following steps occur:

* `R0`-`R6` are cleared to `0`.
* `R7` is set to `0xF4`.
* `PC` and `FL` registers are cleared to `0`.
* RAM is cleared to `0`.

Subsequently, the program can be loaded into RAM starting at address `0x00`.

## Execution Sequence

1. The instruction pointed to by the `PC` is fetched from RAM, decoded, and
   executed.
2. If the instruction does _not_ set the `PC` itself, the `PC` is advanced to
   point to the subsequent instruction.
3. If the CPU is not halted by a `HLT` instruction, go to step 1.

Some instructions set the PC directly. These are:

* CALL
* INT
* IRET
* JMP
* JNE
* JEQ
* JGT
* JGE
* JLT
* JLE
* RET

In these cases, the `PC` does not automatically advance to the next instruction,
since it was set explicitly.

## Instruction Layout

Meanings of the bits in the first byte of each instruction: `AABCDDDD`

* `AA` Number of operands for this opcode, 0-2
* `B` 1 if this is an ALU operation
* `C` 1 if this instruction sets the PC
* `DDDD` Instruction identifier

The number of operands `AA` is useful to know because the total number of bytes in any
instruction is the number of operands + 1 (for the opcode). This
allows you to know how far to advance the `PC` with each instruction.

It might also be useful to check the other bits in an emulator implementation, but
there are other ways to code it that don't do these checks.

## Instruction Set

Glossary:

* **immediate**: takes a constant integer value as an argument
* **register**: takes a register number as an argument

* `iiiiiiii`: 8-bit immediate value
* `00000rrr`: Register number
* `00000aaa`: Register number
* `00000bbb`: Register number

Machine code values shown in both binary and hexadecimal.

### ADD

*This is an instruction handled by the ALU.*

`ADD registerA registerB`

### CALL register

`CALL register`

Calls a subroutine (function) at the address stored in the register.

1. The address of the ***instruction*** _directly after_ `CALL` is
   pushed onto the stack. This allows us to return to where we left off when the subroutine finishes executing.
2. The PC is set to the address stored in the given register. We jump to that location in RAM and execute the first instruction in the subroutine. The PC can move forward or backwards from its current location.

  otherwise set it to 0.

* If registerA is greater than registerB, set the Greater-than `G` flag
  to 1, otherwise set it to 0.
