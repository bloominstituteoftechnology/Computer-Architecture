## File Descriptions

### Computer-Architecture

- .gitignore

Ensures repo stays neat and tidy, i.e. free of pycache files.

- FAQ.md

Answers to low-level conceptual and implementation questions.

- LS8-cheatsheet.md

Simplified psudo-code explanation of LS8-spec.md

- LS8-spec.md

Explains what each type of element in memory array is and how it works with the others.

- README.md

Self Explanatory

### asm

TODO

### ls8

- README.md 

Self Expalantaory

- cpu.py

Defines CPU class for use in ls8.py.

The CPU has a wire frame is already done, but the program itself is hardwired for the print8.ls8 file.

1. The program needs to be modified in order to run dynamically.
2. The program lacks a true RAM array, CALL stack, or appropriate register.
3. The alu currently can only add values together, this will need to be modified to allow for other opertions including:

    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Modulo
    - Bitwise AND
    - Bitwise OR
    - Bitwise NOT
    - Bitwise Shift Left
    - Bitwise Shift Right
    - Bitwise XOR 

4. The run method is incomplete.

- ls8.py

Loads and runs instance of cpu from cpu.py.

### examples

- call.ls8

Contains memory array elements for implementing subroutine calls.
In higher-level jargon, these elements define functions and allow them to be used by the cpu.py and ls8.py programs.

- interrupts.ls8

Contains memeory array elements for imitating time library functionality.

- keyboard.ls8

Program for testing if the a key was pressed at any given time.

- mult.ls8

Contains memory array elements for multiplying 8 and 9 together.

- print8.ls8

Contains memory array elements for printing the number 8.

- printstr.ls8

Contains memory array elements for printing a string.

- sctest.ls8

Used in completing the Histogram Stretch Goal

- stack.ls8

Contains memory array elements for implementing a stack.

- stackoverflow.ls8

Contains memory array elements for testing what happens when the call stack pointer is out of bounds.
