# Computer Architecture

## Project

* [Implement the LS-8 Emulator](ls8/)

## Task List: add this to the first comment of your Pull Request

### Day 1: Get `print8.ls8` running

- [x] Inventory what is here
- [x] Implement the `CPU` constructor
- [x] Add RAM functions `ram_read()` and `ram_write()`
- [x] Implement the core of `run()`
- [x] Implement the `HLT` instruction handler
- [x] Add the `LDI` instruction
- [x] Add the `PRN` instruction

### Day 2: Add the ability to load files dynamically, get `mult.ls8` running

- [x] Un-hardcode the machine code
- [x] Implement the `load()` function to load an `.ls8` file given the filename
        passed in as an argument
- [x] Implement a Multiply instruction (run `mult8.ls8`)

### Day 3: Stack

- [x] Implement the System Stack and be able to run the `stack.ls8` program
- Composition of a stack: 
    a. A place to store data (RAM)
    b. A way to keep track of where the top of the stack is (stack pointer)
    c. A push function
    d. A pop function

- The PUSH function will decrement the stack pointer and then assign a value to the new SP address
- The POP function will write the current SP value to the next available Register (R0 to begin with) and then increment the stack pointer
- Because the stack pointer moves before a value is written, we use only 255 of the 256 addresses

- Uses: Temporary storage of variables, return addres from a sub routine, storage of registers and cpu state while handling an interrupt,
allocation of local variables for a subroutine

#INTERRUPTS
Interrupts are commonly generated by peripherals who need to alert the CPU that some work needs to be done. An example of an interrupt is a key being pressed.
When an interrupt occurs, the current state of the processor is saved on the stack, and execution continues at the address of the _interrupt handler_. 
After the handler completes, the processor state is popped off the stack, thus 'resetting' back to its previous operation. Execution proceeds as normal. 

### Day 4: Get `call.ls8` running

- [ ] Implement the CALL and RET instructions
- [ ] Implement Subroutine Calls and be able to run the `call.ls8` program

### Stretch

- [ ] Add the timer interrupt to the LS-8 emulator
- [ ] Add the keyboard interrupt to the LS-8 emulator
- [ ] Write an LS-8 assembly program to draw a curved histogram on the screen
