# Sprint Challenge: Computer Architecture - Conditional Jumps

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over
the past week and apply them in a concrete project.
During this Sprint, you studied CPU components, number bases, bitwise
operations, CPU stack, interrupts, and subroutines.

In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by adding _conditional jumps_ to your LS-8 emulator as well as answering a few questions during a one-on-one session with a PM.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected
_before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge
score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material
covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts
and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are
encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and
Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your
proficiency with Computer Architecture and your command of the related concepts
and techniques.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you
ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

In this code challenge, you will add _conditional jumps_ (AKA _conditional branching_) to your LS-8 emulator.

## Project Set Up

Options for submission, whichever is easier for you:

- Copy your source into this repo, or...

- Submit a PR for the Sprint Challenge from the `Computer-Architecture` repo
  you've been using all along.

## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

- [ ] Add the `CMP` instruction and `equal` flag to your LS-8.

- [ ] Add the `JMP` instruction.

- [ ] Add the `JEQ` and `JNE` instructions.

[See the LS-8 spec for details](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Computer-Architecture/blob/master/LS8-spec.md)

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce
clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your
work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and
grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP
than one that attempts too much and does not.

Validate your work through testing and ensure that your code operates as designed.

[Here is some code](sctest.ls8) that exercises the above instructions. It should
print:

## Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These
goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on
the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you
can deliver on the following optional goals:

- [ ] Add the ALU operations: `AND` `OR` `XOR` `NOT` `SHL` `SHR` `MOD`
- [ ] Add an `ADDI` extension instruction to add an immediate value to a register
- [ ] Add timer interrupts
- [ ] Add keyboard interrupts
