; Keyboard.asm
;
; A simple program to test the keyboard and echo to console.
;
; Does not interpret anything; CR just moves the cursor to the start of the
; line, BS doesn't work, etc.

; Hook the keyboard interrupt

	LDI R0,0xF9		  ; R0 holds the interrupt vector for I1 (keyboard)
	LDI R1,IntHandler	; R1 holds the address of the handler
	ST R0,R1			 ; Store handler addr in int vector
	LDI R5,2			 ; Enable keyboard interrupts
	LDI R0,Loop
Loop:
	JMP R0			   ; Infinite spin loop

; Interrupt handler
IntHandler:
	LDI R0,0xF4		  ; Memory location of most recent key pressed
	LD R1,R0			 ; load R1 from that memory address
	PRA R1			   ; Print it
